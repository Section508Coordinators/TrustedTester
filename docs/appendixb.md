Appendix B: Document Change Log
===============================

Note: Minor punctuation, formatting and spelling changes not included.

Version 5.0, June 2019
----------------------

Version 5.0 is a wholesale change to the test process and supporting content. This version contains significant changes to the test processes to address the Section 508 Refresh and incorporation of the WCAG 2.0 Level A and Level AA Success Criteria. However, the document also includes a number of other changes to improve the organization and flow of the document, test condition logic, and readability of test process instructions. These changes include:

-   General alignment of Test Condition construction with the draft W3C Accessibility Conformance Testing (ACT) Task Force Test Rules Format.

-   Removed references to Failure Conditions and reconstructed as Test Conditions with positive pass/fail construction to eliminate double negatives.

-   More straightforward Test Conditions and explanation for when tests do not apply. The revised test process includes conditions for identifying content to test. If those conditions are not met, the test does not apply.

-   Test sections re-grouped and/or renamed to use terms that are not mutually exclusive.

-   Clearer alignment of “How to Test” instructions to each Test Condition.

-   Addition of unique and descriptive test names to help identify the Test Condition without having to look up the Test Condition by Test ID.

Finally, the test process has adopted a new testing tool: the Accessible Name and Description Inspector (ANDI). ANDI replaces all of the tools used in previous versions of the test process. ANDI also adds a significant number of new functions and features to facilitate the Trusted Tester process.
