Section 508 Conformance Tests
=============================

<span id="_Toc516043109" class="anchor"><span id="_Toc516043115" class="anchor"></span></span>Each of the Test Conditions included in each test section below is a statement that can be evaluated as **TRUE** or **FALSE**. The “How to Test” content included under each Test Condition provides instructions on how to evaluate whether content **PASSES** the condition:

-   If a Test Condition is **TRUE** for the content in question, then the content **PASSES** that Test Condition.

-   If a Test Condition is **FALSE** for the content in question, then the content **FAILS** that Test Condition.

-   A Test Condition **DOES NOT APPLY (DNA)** only if content does not exist that meets the conditions described in the “Identify Content” instructions at the beginning of each test section.

-   In very limited instances specifically described in this test process, a Test Condition is **NOT TESTED** if content exists that meets the Identify Content criteria for a test, but a test cannot be performed due to limitations in available test tools.
